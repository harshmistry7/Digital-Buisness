## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (choose one)

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/harshmistry7/Digital-Buisness.git](https://github.com/harshmistry7/Digital-Buisness.git)
    cd Digital-Buisness
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Choose your preferred package manager (check for `package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for yarn, or `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your console) with your browser to see the result.

4.  **Start editing!**
    * If using the **App Router**, your main page is likely `app/page.js` (or `.tsx`).
    * If using the **Pages Router**, your main page is likely `pages/index.js` (or `.tsx`).
    The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
